# ðŸ§¹ GLEAN - Go Local Environment Auto Node_modules Cleaner

**GLEAN** is a blazing-fast, concurrent CLI tool written in Go that **recursively finds and deletes all `node_modules` folders** (or any other bloated folders) in a given directory.  
Itâ€™s perfect for developers who want to **free up gigabytes of disk space** from old, unused projects without hunting folders one by one.

---

## Why GLEAN?

- Recursively scans large directories
- Deletes folders using a **parallel worker pool (goroutines)**
- Cleans your system **faster than traditional shell scripts**
- Supports `--dry-run` mode for safe previews
- Customizable: set your own folder name, worker count
